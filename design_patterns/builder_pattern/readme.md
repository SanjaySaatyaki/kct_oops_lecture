- some objects are simple and can be created in single initalizer call
- Other require lot of ceremony to create
- Having an object with 10 initalizer arguments is not productive
- Instead opt for piecewise construction
- builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step

when piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly
