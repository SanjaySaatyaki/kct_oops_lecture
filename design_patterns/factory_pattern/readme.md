- Object Creation login becomes too convoluted
- Initalizer is not descriptive
    -- Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with differnt names

    -- A seperate method(Factory Method)
    -- That may exist in a seperate class(Factory)
    -- Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory
